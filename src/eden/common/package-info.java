/**
 * The ED7 ENTERTAINMENT (EDEN) Java Library API provides utilities to assist
 * the development of (hopefully) any Java application.
 *
 * Each module in this library is derived from the project they were once
 * developed for. At certain parts of development, project-specific modules
 * underwent a fitness assessment. Passing modules were refactored to isolate
 * any dependencies on other project-specific modules.
 *
 * "With this hand-coded library, I hope to have spread our greatly-ignored
 * needs for ethical computing, user privacy and freedom, and humanity."
 *
 * 11/06/2021: This API has been deprecated in favor of EDJC. See
 * [https://ed7n.github.io/edjc].
